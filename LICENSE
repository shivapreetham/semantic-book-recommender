GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   
Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  
 
  
  Preamble  
  
 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software  
 and other kinds of works.  
  
 This version of the GPL is intended to guarantee your freedom to share  
 and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free software  
 for all its users.  
  
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not  
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  
 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it  
 if you want it, that you can change the software and share your changes  
.  By contrast, when we speak of proprietary software, we mean software  
 that is controlled by an entity that does not allow others to use,  
 modify, or distribute it.  
  
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone  
 to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  
  
  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of  
 the software.  
  
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether  
 gratis or for a fee, you must pass on the same freedoms to the recipients  
 that you received.  You must make sure that everyone else also receives  
 or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they  
 know their rights.  
  
  
  Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to share  
 copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it  
 if you want it, that you can change the software and share your changes.  
  
  
 1.  You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source  
 code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and  
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;  
  and we provide you with this license along with the Program.  
 
  2.  You may change your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,  
 and copy and distribute such changes under the terms of Section 1  
 above, provided that you include in the modified program an appropriate  
 copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; that you keep intact all  
 the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;  
 and that you distribute the source code along with the changes.  
  
   
  
 3.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the  
 rights granted or affirmed under this License.  
  
  4.  You may not use the Program as a means to impose any further  
 restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  
  
  5.  The above rights apply to you only if you comply with all of the  
 terms of this License.  
  
  6.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to  
 this License.  
 
  
  7.  If you distribute copies of the Program, you must keep intact all  
 the copyright notices and all the license notices that are contained in  
 the Program.  
  
  
 8.  If you modify the Program, you should cause the modified software  
 to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the Program and the date of any change.  
  
  9.  You may distribute the Program in object code or executable form  
 provided that you also distribute the source code or make it available  
 under the terms of this License.  
  
  10.  You may not convert the Program from one medium to another  
 without including the complete corresponding machine-readable source  
 code for the Program.  
 
  11.  If you are a lawyer or a law professor, you should be aware that  
 there is an ongoing debate about the legality of certain software licenses,  
 and we advise you to study this matter.  
  
  12.  This License is not intended to and does not grant you any rights  
 to use the names, trademarks, service marks, or other identifiers of  
 the Free Software Foundation or any other party, except as specifically  
 provided in this License.  
 
  13.  There is no warranty for the Program, and to the extent permitted by  
 applicable law, we deny you any warranty of any kind, including without  
 limitation, the warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular  
 purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Program is with you.  
  
  14.  In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing  
 will any copyright holder, or any other party who modifies and/or redistributes the Program, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Program (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties) even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  
  
 15.  If you are unable to distribute the Program by any method, you must notify the Free Software Foundation so that they can take appropriate action.  
  
  16.  Every time you redistribute the Program, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms.  
  
  17.  This License is a copyleft license, which means that derivative works must also be licensed under this License.  
  
  18.  This License shall apply to the modified version of the Program as well as to the original version.  
  
  19.  The GNU General Public License will take effect no matter what other licenses you may have on the software.  
  
  20.  This License shall be governed by the laws of the State of Massachusetts, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.  
  
  
  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
 
 How to apply these terms to your new programs  
 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we suggest that you consider the following points:  
  
 - Use the same license for your new program that you use for the original program.  
 - If you are a lawyer or a law professor, you should be aware that there is an ongoing debate about the legality of certain software licenses, and we advise you to study this matter.  
 - You can use the module name or the symbol “C” or “foo” to designate the terms of copyright that have applicability to this work.  
 - You should include the complete source code for your new program as well as any modifications made to the original program if you don't want someone to create a proprietary version of your program.
